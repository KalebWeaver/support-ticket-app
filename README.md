# Support Ticket App

## Description
I began with this project to tackle some new concepts. I had worked with Redux-Toolkit in past projects using asyncThunks and using Axios to make basic CRUD calls to the backend. During those projects I had run into UI/UX issues with not being able to properly cache data to give the user a more responsive experience in dealing with data changes. Given this issue, I had decided to dip my toes into RTK Query with their Apollo/GraphQL like caching and query/mutation handling of data from a backend server. While simplistic on the users point of view, I had focused alot of the effort into more intricate functionality with the features described below.

## Features
- Fully built express server that serves the static frontend build for ease of deployment and simplicity.
- Full JWT authentication including Access Tokens and Refresh Tokens.
- Redux Toolkit for handling state management.
- RTK Query to handle Caching and automatic rehydration of data sent to and from backend server
